        <p>
          Hi, my name is Alistair Chambers and I am a student with experience in Java, C, MIPS Assembly, Verilog, HTML, and JavaScript.
          I am passionate about creating simple games and have developed several games using JavaScript and Java.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new programming languages and technologies. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.
